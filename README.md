# RuneDream

RuneDream is a simple tower defense/RTS hybrid written in HTML5 and JavaScript.
Drag the top rune from the stack to one of the two circles to create or upgrade a tower.
Towers fire at incoming enemies until their ammo runs out. Dragging a rune onto a tower
with a duplicate shape and color will destroy that tower. You can also drag a rune back to
the stack area to discard it.

The game ends after 5 minutes or when an enemy reaches either circle.
