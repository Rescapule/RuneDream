# RuneDream

RuneDream is a simple endless runner prototype. Control the Wisp Dragon with keyboard controls while collecting coins and avoiding obstacles.

## Controls

- **Jump**: `Space` or `ArrowUp`
- **Dash**: `Control` or `X`

## Play

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. You'll see a launch screen with a **Start Game** button. Clicking it opens the game in its own window. The game is designed with mobile in mind, so touch controls can be added later.

To avoid asset-loading issues, start a local web server in the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser. Opening the file directly may show only a blank canvas.
